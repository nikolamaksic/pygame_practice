# Python Practice Projects 🎮🐍

This repository contains various Python projects where I practice my programming skills, with a particular focus on **Pygame** for game development. Because I like playing PC and Board games I start working on this project so I can create something fun
and also to practice my general programming(and Python) skills.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`practice/`** – folder containing example tutorials that already exist and that I followed step by step. (I will update the references soon.)
  - My own original creations exploring different game mechanics and programming concepts for well know games.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pygame** 🎮

## 🚀 Goals
- Improve Python proficiency.
- Learn **best coding practices** and explore creative project ideas.
- Fun

## 🔗 Current focus
- Develop "Catan" (The Settlers of Catan)
